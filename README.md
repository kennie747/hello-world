# hello-world
This is my very first repo
Well, as I mentioned in the description, this is my very first repo, and I'm finding it very interesting.
It's a very interesting concept, and while I consider myself a good programmer, I am always facinated when I come across new things I haven't employed before.

Thanks for yor audience.

Kennie.
